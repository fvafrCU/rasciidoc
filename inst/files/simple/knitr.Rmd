* A list with a [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink).
* Yet another entry in the list.

Do not use the _include_ macro provided by asciidoc!+ 
``` {r, code = readLines("src/sum.R")}
```

``` {r, code = readLines("src/my_sum.R")}
```

print(value)
``` 

``` {r}
print(my_sum(1:3))

Some inline code: Object `value` has value `r value`.
