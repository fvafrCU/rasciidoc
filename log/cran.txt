Please write package names and software names in single quotes (e.g. 
'knitr') in title and description.

Please ensure that your functions do not write by default or in your 
examples in the user's home filespace. That is not allow by CRAN 
policies. Please only write/save files if the user has specified a 
directory. In your examples you can write to tempdir().


We also get:
Check: tests, Result: ERROR
See attached summary for details.

Please fix and resubmit.

Best,
Swetlana Herbrandt
